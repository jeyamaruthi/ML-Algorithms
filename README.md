This dataset contains information about 891 people who were on board the ship when departed on April 15th, 1912. As noted in the description on Kaggle's website, some people aboard the ship were more likely to survive the wreck than others. There were not enough lifeboats for everybody so women, children, and the upper-class were prioritized. Using the information about these 891 passengers, the challenge is to build a model to predict which people would survive
